### Abstract

This dissertation examines epistemic justice as a fiduciary and ethical responsibility of universities, framing higher education institutions as stewards of an epistemic commons. I argue that universities bear positive duties to institutionalise epistemic openness and actively counter epistemic injustice. Drawing on Fricker’s theory of epistemic injustice, Anderson’s systemic account of epistemic justice, fiduciary ethics, and educational philosophy (Freire, Mill, Rawls), I develop a normative framework that integrates Western and Chinese philosophical perspectives, including Confucian reciprocity, Zhuangzian perspectivism, and Taoist epistemic humility.

Through comparative statutory analysis, I assess the United Kingdom’s Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 alongside constitutional protections in Germany, statutory ambiguity in France, and statutory minimalism in the Netherlands. These contrasts show how legislative frameworks shape institutional practices, highlighting the limitations of purely legal protections. Empirical case studies—including participatory methodologies (Boni & Velasco), microfascist institutional dynamics (Kuyumcu & Méndez-Grueso), and controversies in Groningen and Grenoble—illustrate persistent exclusionary practices and demonstrate the necessity of internal fiduciary governance.

I propose concrete institutional mechanisms to embed epistemic openness: epistemic audits, oversight roles such as Epistemic Ombudspersons, inclusive pedagogical approaches, and transparent accountability frameworks. These measures provide universities with normative clarity and practical strategies for cultivating an epistemic culture that is open, inclusive, and resilient. By embedding epistemic justice in governance, universities can fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities, strengthen legitimacy, and sustain their role as genuine custodians of knowledge.
